# Tagging System Enhancements - Phase 1

## Overview
This document outlines the planned enhancements to Court Vision's core tagging and plays system. The tagging system is the engine of the app, enabling real-time basketball play analysis with categories for offensive, defensive, and special situations.

## Recent Data Improvements âœ… **COMPLETED - December 2024**

### Comprehensive Game Data Sync âœ…
- **Full Season Coverage**: Synced complete 2024-25 NBA season data (October 2024 - April 2025)
- **Total Games**: 1,347 games in database (1,247 from 2025, 100 from 2024)
- **Date Range**: January 1, 2024 to June 23, 2025
- **Granular Sync**: Used 14 date ranges to ensure complete coverage

### Team Statistics Accuracy âœ…
- **Games Played**: Teams now have 83-95 games (realistic for NBA season)
- **Win/Loss Records**: Accurate records like Thunder (75W-16L, 82.4%) and Celtics (69W-25L, 73.4%)
- **Scoring Averages**: Realistic PPG ranging from 104.7 to 121.1
- **Data Source**: Statistics calculated from actual game data, not API estimates

### Key Improvements Achieved âœ…
1. **Complete Season Data**: No longer missing October-December 2024 games
2. **Accurate Team Stats**: All statistics based on real game outcomes
3. **Realistic Numbers**: Win percentages, scoring, and game counts now match expectations
