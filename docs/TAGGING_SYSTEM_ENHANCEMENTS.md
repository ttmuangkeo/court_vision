# Tagging System Enhancements - Phase 1

## Overview
This document outlines the planned enhancements to Court Vision's core tagging and plays system. The tagging system is the engine of the app, enabling real-time basketball play analysis with categories for offensive, defensive, and special situations.

## Current System Analysis

### Core Components
- **Plays**: Individual basketball actions with timestamps, players, and game context
- **Tags**: Categorized actions (offensive, defensive, special situations)
- **Sequences**: Chains of related actions for complex play analysis
- **Verification**: Multiple users tagging the same play (isVerified field)

### Current Tag Categories
- **Offensive Actions**: Scoring, passing, ball handling
- **Defensive Actions**: Steals, blocks, defensive positioning
- **Special Situations**: Fouls, timeouts, game management

## Phase 1 Enhancement Plan

### 1. Enhanced Tag Categories âœ… **COMPLETED - Phase 1A**

#### Defensive Schemes âœ…
- **Man-to-Man Defense**: Individual player assignments
- **Zone Defense 2-3**: Zone defense with 2 players at the top, 3 in the paint
- **Zone Defense 3-2**: Zone defense with 3 players at the top, 2 in the paint
- **Full-Court Press**: Aggressive defensive pressure across the entire court
- **Trap Defense**: Double-teaming strategy to force turnovers or bad passes
- **Help Defense**: Defensive rotation and support actions
- **Switch Defense**: Defensive assignment exchanges on screens

#### Offensive Actions âœ…
- **Pick and Roll**: Ball handler uses screen and rolls to the basket
- **Pick and Pop**: Screen setter pops out for perimeter shot
- **Off-Ball Cut**: Player without ball makes cutting movement
- **Off-Ball Screen**: Screen set for player without the ball
- **Post Up**: Player establishes position in the post
- **Transition Offense**: Fast break opportunity after defensive rebound or turnover
- **Set Play**: Designed offensive sequence from timeout or inbound

#### Special Situations âœ…
- **End-of-Game Scenario**: Clutch time management in final minutes
- **Strategic Foul**: Intentional foul to stop clock or force free throws
- **Timeout Usage**: Strategic timeout call for play design or momentum
- **Coach Challenge**: Coach challenges referee decision
- **Technical Foul**: Behavioral or administrative foul

#### Enhanced Player Actions âœ…
- **Pull Up Shot**: Player stops and shoots off the dribble
- **Step Back Shot**: Player steps back to create shooting space
- **Fade Away Shot**: Player shoots while moving backward
- **Euro Step**: Two-step move to avoid defender
- **Spin Move**: 360-degree rotation to evade defender

### 2. Team Context Tracking âœ… **COMPLETED - Phase 1B**

#### Database Schema Updates âœ…
- Added `offensiveTeamId` and `defensiveTeamId` to Play model
- Added `gameSituation` and `teamContext` JSON fields to Play model
- Created `TeamContext` model for detailed team-level tracking
- Added `ContextType` enum for categorizing context data
- Updated Team model with new relations

#### Team-Level Analytics âœ…
- **Defensive Schemes by Quarter**: Track defensive strategy changes
- **Offensive Efficiency by Play Type**: Success rates for different actions
- **Player Rotation Patterns**: Substitution timing and frequency
- **Timeout Effectiveness**: Success rates after timeouts
- **End-of-Game Performance**: Clutch time statistics

### 3. Enhanced Sequence Support âœ… **COMPLETED - Phase 1B**

#### Pattern Recognition âœ…
- **Common Play Patterns**: 6 predefined basketball patterns
- **Sequence Analysis**: Analyze play sequences for pattern matches
- **Next Action Prediction**: Predict likely next actions based on current sequence
- **Team Tendency Tracking**: Track team-specific patterns and tendencies

#### Pattern Recognition Service âœ…
- Created `patternRecognition.js` service with analysis functions
- Implemented sequence matching algorithms
- Added team tendency analysis
- Created API endpoints for pattern analysis

#### API Endpoints âœ…
- `GET /api/patterns` - Get all common patterns
- `POST /api/patterns/analyze` - Analyze play sequence
- `POST /api/patterns/predict` - Predict next action
- `GET /api/patterns/team-tendencies/:teamId` - Get team tendencies

### 4. Decision Quality Analysis ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS - Phase 1C**

#### Coaching Insights
- **Timeout Effectiveness**: Success rates after strategic timeouts
- **Substitution Timing**: Impact of player rotations
- **Play Call Success**: Effectiveness of designed plays
- **Defensive Adjustments**: Response to offensive changes

#### Player Decision Making
- **Shot Selection**: Quality of shot attempts
- **Passing Decisions**: Risk vs. reward analysis
- **Defensive Positioning**: Effectiveness of defensive choices
- **Clutch Performance**: Pressure situation handling

### 5. Real-Time Smart Suggestions ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS - Phase 1C**

#### Context-Based Recommendations
- **Game Situation Awareness**: Suggest relevant actions based on context
- **Player Tendency Integration**: Leverage historical player data
- **Team Pattern Recognition**: Suggest actions based on team tendencies
- **Opponent Analysis**: Consider opponent's defensive patterns

#### Predictive Features
- **Next Play Prediction**: Suggest likely upcoming actions
- **Player Substitution Timing**: Predict optimal rotation timing
- **Timeout Usage**: Suggest strategic timeout opportunities
- **Defensive Adjustments**: Recommend defensive scheme changes
